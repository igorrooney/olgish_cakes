## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES - FIXED

### 1. Homepage Product Schema ✅
**File:** `app/page.tsx`
- ✅ Fixed nested Product schema in reviews - now uses `@id` reference
- ✅ Product schema has `offers`, `aggregateRating`, and `review`

**Status:** Fixed in code. Waiting for Google re-crawl (last crawled: Oct 30, 2025)

---

### 2. Gift Hampers Listing Page ✅
**File:** `app/gift-hampers/page.tsx`
- ✅ Enhanced ItemList schema to include full Product objects
- ✅ Each product now has:
  - `offers` with `shippingDetails` and `hasMerchantReturnPolicy`

**Status:** Fixed - ready for re-indexing

---

### 3. GiftHamperCard Component ✅
**File:** `app/components/GiftHamperCard.tsx`

**Status:** Fixed

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - FIXED

### 4. CakeCard Component ✅
**File:** `app/components/CakeCard.tsx`
- ✅ Enhanced description field - now checks `shortDescription`, then `description`, then fallback
- ✅ Fixed review schema to reference main product by `@id` instead of nested Product
- ✅ Already has `shippingDetails` and `hasMerchantReturnPolicy` ✅

**Status:** Fixed

---

### 5. Birthday Cakes Page ✅

**Status:** Fixed

---

### 6. Breadcrumb Names ✅
**File:** `app/components/Breadcrumbs.tsx`
- ✅ Added route name mapping for common routes
- ✅ Enhanced name generation with multiple fallbacks
- ✅ Ensures all breadcrumb items have proper names (no "Unnamed item")

**Status:** Fixed in code. Waiting for Google re-crawl

---

## 📊 FAQ Schema Status

**Status:** ✅ All FAQ schemas have proper `name` fields

**Verified:**
- ✅ `app/birthday-cakes/page.tsx` - All questions have names
- ✅ `app/gift-hampers/page.tsx` - All questions have names
- ✅ `app/cake-delivery-leeds/page.tsx` - All questions have names
- ✅ `app/cakes-wakefield/page.tsx` - All questions have names
- ✅ `app/faq/page.tsx` - All questions have names

**Note:** GSC showing "Unnamed item" for FAQ is likely:
1. Google caching old versions
2. Google extraction issue with certain FAQ formats
3. Will resolve after re-indexing

## 📝 Notes

### Why Some Errors Still Show in GSC

- **Re-crawl needed:** Last crawls were in October 2025, fixes were just applied
- **Time to update:** Typically 24-72 hours after re-indexing request

### Expected Resolution Timeline
- **Re-indexing request:** Immediate
- **Google processing:** 24-72 hours
- **Errors cleared:** 3-7 days after re-crawl
