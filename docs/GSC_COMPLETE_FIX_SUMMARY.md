## 🔍 FIX PATTERN APPLIED

### Review Schema Transformation

**Before (❌ Incorrect - Causes GSC Errors):**
```typescript
review: [{
  "@type": "Review",
  itemReviewed: {
    "@type": "Product",
    name: "Product Name",
    description: "...",
    brand: { "@type": "Brand", name: "..." }
  },
  reviewRating: { ... },
  // ...
}]
```

**After (✅ Correct - GSC Compliant):**
```typescript
review: [{
  "@type": "Review",
  itemReviewed: {
    "@id": "https://olgishcakes.co.uk/cakes/product-slug#product"
  },
  reviewRating: { 
    "@type": "Rating",
    ratingValue: "5",
    bestRating: "5",

  },
  // ...
}]
