## Google Search Console Compliance
All product pages now include at least one of the required properties:
- ✅ **offers**: Price and availability information
- ✅ **review**: Customer reviews and ratings
- ✅ **aggregateRating**: Overall rating summary

This should resolve the Google Search Console error:
"Either 'offers', 'review' or 'aggregateRating' should be specified."

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the changes to production
2. Wait for Google to re-crawl the pages (24-48 hours)
3. Use Google's Rich Results Test tool to validate: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
