## ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND

### 1. 🔴 CRITICAL - Pages Need Re-Crawling

**Problem:** Pages were last crawled in **October 2025** but we made important changes recently:
- Pricing updates (£35 → £25)
- Metadata changes
- FAQ schema updates

**Impact:** Google is showing **outdated pricing** in search results

**Solution:** Request indexing (you're doing this manually - good!)

---

### 2. 🟡 WARNING - Sitemap Not Fully Indexed

**Status:**
- **Submitted:** 100 URLs
- **Indexed:** 0 URLs
- **Last downloaded:** September 18, 2025 (very old!)
- **Status:** Pending

**This is concerning but may be a GSC reporting delay.**

**Action:** 
- Re-submit sitemap: `https://olgishcakes.co.uk/sitemap.xml`
- Check GSC Coverage report for actual indexed count
- Sitemap shows as "pending" which might be normal

### 3. 🟡 WARNING - Product Schema Missing Fields

**Issue:** Multiple product schemas missing required fields:

**Missing on Birthday Cakes page:**
- `description` field (some products)
- `shippingDetails` field (some products)
- `hasMerchantReturnPolicy` field (some products)

**Missing on Wakefield page:**
- `shippingDetails` field (all products)
- `hasMerchantReturnPolicy` field (all products)

**Severity:** WARNING (not critical, but affects Google Merchant Center eligibility)

**Impact:** 
- Products may not appear in Google Shopping
- Reduced rich result eligibility
- Lower merchant listing quality score

**Products Affected:**
- Kyiv Cake
- Chocolate Delicia Sponge Cake
- Sacher Torte
- Vanilla Delicia Birthday Cake

**Priority:** Medium (can fix later, but affects Google Shopping)

### 4. 🟢 MINOR - Breadcrumb Schema "Unnamed Items"
