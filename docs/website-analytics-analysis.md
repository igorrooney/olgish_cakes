---

## 📊 Executive Summary

- **474 sessions** (avg 1.8 sessions per user - good repeat traffic!)
- **2,234 page views** (avg 4.7 pages/session - excellent engagement)

---

## 🎯 Critical Findings & Opportunities

### 🚨 **ISSUE 1: Admin Pages Dominating Traffic**
**Problem:** Admin pages are your top viewed pages!

| Page | Views | Issue |
|------|-------|-------|
| /admin/orders | 169 | Should be excluded from analytics |
| /admin/blog | 92 | Should be excluded |
| /admin | 89 + 44 = 133 | Should be excluded |
| /admin/login | 42 | Should be excluded |

**Total Admin Views:** 436 out of 2,234 (19.5% of all traffic!)

**Impact:** This is inflating your numbers and hiding real customer behavior.

**Fix Needed:** Exclude /admin/* from GA4 tracking

---

### ✅ **STRENGTH 1: Strong Organic Search Performance**

**Traffic Sources:**
| Source | Sessions | Percentage | Quality |
|--------|----------|------------|---------|
| Direct | 177 | 37% | ✅ Brand awareness working |
| **Organic Search** | **173** | **37%** | ✅ SEO is working! |
| Referral | 72 | 15% | ✅ External links working |
| Unassigned | 32 | 7% | ⚠️ Need better tracking |
| Organic Social | 20 | 4% | 💡 Opportunity to grow |

**Insight:** You have nearly **perfect balance** between Direct and Organic Search. This shows:
- ✅ Your SEO efforts are working
- ✅ Brand recognition is building  
- ✅ People remember your name and come back

**With GSC showing 28 clicks in last 28 days but GA showing 173 organic sessions**, there's a tracking discrepancy (likely due to date ranges or different counting methods).

---

### 💰 **STRENGTH 2: Conversion Funnel is Working!**

**Conversion Events (Last 30 Days):**
```
1. page_view: 2,234 (baseline)
2. form_start: 70 (3.1% of sessions started a form)
3. begin_checkout: 18 (0.8% reached checkout)
4. order_form_submit: 2 (0.1% completed orders)
```

**Conversion Funnel:**
```
474 sessions
↓ (14.8% engagement)
70 form starts
↓ (25.7% progression)
18 begin checkout
↓ (11.1% completion)
2 order submissions
```

**Conversion Rate:** 0.42% (2 orders ÷ 474 sessions)

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **14.8% form start rate is GOOD** (industry avg: 5-10%)
- ✅ **25.7% checkout progression is EXCELLENT**
- 🚨 **11.1% checkout completion is LOW** (should be 30-50%)

**Opportunity:** You're losing 16 potential orders at the final checkout step!

## 📍 Geographic Analysis - CRITICAL INSIGHT

**User Locations:**

| City | Users | % | Insight |
|------|-------|---|---------|
| London | 42 | 16% | 🔍 Not your service area! |
| Manchester | 36 | 13.7% | 🔍 Not your service area! |
| **(not set)** | 34 | 12.9% | ⚠️ Tracking issue |
| **Leeds** | **32** | **12.2%** | ✅ Your primary market |
| Bath | 17 | 6.5% | 🔍 Not your service area |
| Huddersfield | 3 | 1.1% | ⚠️ Too low (648 GSC impressions!) |
| Birmingham | 3 | 1.1% | 🔍 Not your service area |
| Wakefield | 0 | 0% | 🚨 MISSING (648 GSC impressions!) |
| Bradford | 0 | 0% | 🚨 MISSING (208 GSC impressions!) |

### 🚨 **CRITICAL PROBLEM:**

You're getting traffic from London, Manchester, Bath (cities where you DON'T deliver), but almost ZERO traffic from Wakefield, Bradford, Huddersfield (where you DO deliver and have 1,000+ GSC impressions!).

**Why This Happens:**
1. **Informational searches:** London/Manchester people searching "Ukrainian cakes" for information
2. **Transactional searches:** Leeds/Wakefield people want to ORDER, but your meta descriptions didn't convert them to clicks (until today's fixes!)
3. **GSC vs GA timing:** GSC shows impressions (people SEE you), GA shows clicks (people VISIT)

**Expected Change After Today's Fixes:**
- Wakefield should jump to 30-50 users/month
- Huddersfield should jump to 15-30 users/month
- Bradford should jump to 10-20 users/month
- Leeds should double to 60+ users/month

| Tablet | 5 | 1% | ✅ Normal |

**Insight:** Nearly perfect 50/50 split between desktop and mobile.

**Action:** Continue mobile-first approach - it's working!

## 🎯 Conversion Analysis - Where You're Losing Money

**The Numbers:**
```
474 total sessions
↓
70 form starts (14.8% - EXCELLENT)
↓
18 begin checkout (25.7% of form starts - EXCELLENT)
↓
2 order submissions (11.1% of checkouts - TERRIBLE)
```

### **🚨 Problem: 16 Lost Orders at Checkout!**

**What This Means:**
- 18 people clicked "Order Now" / "Begin Checkout"
- Only 2 actually submitted the order form
- **You lost 16 potential customers** (89% abandonment rate!)

**Potential Reasons:**
1. Form too complicated?
2. Unexpected delivery costs?
3. No clear pricing?
4. Payment method issues?
5. Form validation errors?
6. Mobile form issues?
7. Trust/security concerns?

**Revenue Impact:**
- 16 lost orders × £60 average = **£960 lost revenue** in 30 days!
- Annually: **£11,520 in lost revenue**

**Fix This:** If you reduce abandonment from 89% to 50%:
- 18 checkouts × 50% completion = 9 orders/month
- 9 orders × £60 = £540/month vs current £120/month
- **+£420/month extra revenue** (+350% increase!)
