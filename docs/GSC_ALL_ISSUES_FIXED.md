## 🔍 DETAILED FIX SUMMARY

### Review Schema Pattern Fixed
**Before (❌ Incorrect):**
```typescript
review: [{
  "@type": "Review",
  itemReviewed: {
    "@type": "Product",
    name: "Product Name",
    description: "Product description",
    brand: { "@type": "Brand", name: "Olgish Cakes" }
  },
  // ...
}]
```

**After (✅ Correct):**
```typescript
review: [{
  "@type": "Review",
  itemReviewed: {
    "@id": "https://olgishcakes.co.uk/#product"
  },
  // ...
}]
