## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE - FIXED

### Homepage Product Schema Error
**Issue:** Nested Product schema in review's `itemReviewed` was missing required fields (`offers`, `review`, or `aggregateRating`)

**Location:** `app/page.tsx` (lines 308-312)

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed nested Product object to reference main product by `@id` instead
- **Before:**
  ```typescript
  itemReviewed: {
    "@type": "Product",
    name: "Ukrainian Honey Cake",
    description: "Traditional Ukrainian honey cake and other authentic desserts"
  }
  ```
- **After:**
  ```typescript
  itemReviewed: {
    "@id": "https://olgishcakes.co.uk/#product"
  }
  ```

**Result:** ✅ Critical error resolved - reviews now properly reference the main product schema which has all required fields (`offers`, `aggregateRating`, `review`)

## 🟡 WARNINGS - FIXED

### Birthday Cakes Page - Missing Product Schema Fields
**Issue:** Products in `productListJsonLd` were missing `hasMerchantReturnPolicy` field

**Location:** `app/birthday-cakes/page.tsx` (lines 222-256)

**Fix Applied:**
- Added import for `getOfferShippingDetails` and `getMerchantReturnPolicy`
- Replaced hardcoded `shippingDetails` object with `getOfferShippingDetails()` call
- Added `hasMerchantReturnPolicy: getMerchantReturnPolicy()`

**Before:**
```typescript
offers: {
  "@type": "Offer",
  price: cake?.pricing?.standard ?? 0,
  priceCurrency: "GBP",
  availability: "https://schema.org/InStock",
  priceValidUntil: getPriceValidUntil(30),
  shippingDetails: {
    // ... hardcoded shipping details
  },
  // ❌ Missing hasMerchantReturnPolicy
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
offers: {
  "@type": "Offer",
  price: cake?.pricing?.standard ?? 0,
  priceCurrency: "GBP",
  availability: "https://schema.org/InStock",
  priceValidUntil: getPriceValidUntil(30),
  shippingDetails: getOfferShippingDetails(),
  hasMerchantReturnPolicy: getMerchantReturnPolicy(), // ✅ Added
}
```

**Result:** ✅ All products on birthday-cakes page now have required merchant fields
