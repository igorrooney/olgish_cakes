          <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2, fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
            Ukrainian baking traditions date back centuries, with roots in ancient Slavic culture.
            The fertile soil of Ukraine, known as the "breadbasket of Europe," provided abundant
            wheat, honey, and dairy products that became the foundation of traditional baking.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
            These traditions were passed down through generations, with each family developing their
            own variations of classic recipes. Today, these time-honored techniques continue to
            inspire modern Ukrainian bakers around the world.
