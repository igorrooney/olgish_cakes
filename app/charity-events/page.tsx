              Giving back to the community is very important to me. Through my Ukrainian cakes and baking skills,
              I have the opportunity to support local charities, help families in need, and bring joy to people
              who are going through difficult times. Every charity event I participate in is a chance to share
              the warmth and comfort that Ukrainian cakes can bring to any celebration.

              I believe that food, especially traditional Ukrainian cakes, has the power to bring people together,
              comfort those in need, and create moments of joy even during difficult times. My charity work focuses
              on supporting local communities, helping families, and sharing the cultural heritage of Ukrainian baking.

                    Last Christmas, we raised over ¬£2,000 through cake sales and donations, providing
                    special holiday cakes and treats to 50 families who were struggling financially.
                    The joy on children's faces when they received their surprise Christmas cakes
                    made all the hard work worthwhile.

                    We regularly support Ukrainian cultural events in Leeds, providing traditional cakes
                    for Independence Day celebrations, cultural festivals, and community gatherings.
                    These events help keep Ukrainian traditions alive and bring comfort to families
                    who are far from their homeland.

                    We partner with local schools to provide birthday cakes for children whose families
                    cannot afford them. This ensures every child can celebrate their special day with
                    a beautiful cake, regardless of their family's financial situation.
