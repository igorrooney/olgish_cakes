                <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary" sx={{ lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
                  Never store a cake while it is still warm. This creates condensation that will make the cake soggy and affect the texture. 
                  Always let your cake cool completely before wrapping and storing.

                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary" sx={{ lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
                  Not wrapping your cake properly allows air to reach it, making it dry and stale. Always use airtight containers 
                  or wrap tightly in plastic wrap to maintain freshness and prevent the cake from absorbing other flavours.

                  Storing cakes in the wrong temperature can ruin them. Cream-filled cakes must be refrigerated, while some decorated cakes 
                  are better at room temperature. Know your cake type and store accordingly.
