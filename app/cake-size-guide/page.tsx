            When I talk about serving sizes, I mean generous portions that will satisfy your guests. 
            Ukrainian cakes are rich and flavorful, so people often eat smaller portions than with regular cakes. 
            Here is what you need to know about portion planning:
          </Typography>
          <Grid container spacing={4}>
            <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
              <Box sx={{ mb: 4 }}>
                <Typography variant="h5" component="h3" sx={{ mb: 2, fontWeight: 600, color: "primary.main" }}>
                  Standard Portion Size
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary" sx={{ lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
                  A standard portion is about 2 inches by 2 inches (5cm x 5cm) - roughly the size of a small slice 
                  of bread. This is perfect for most celebrations where people want to enjoy the cake without feeling too full. 
                  It allows everyone to try the cake and leaves room for other food.

            </Grid>
            <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>

                <Typography variant="h5" component="h3" sx={{ mb: 2, fontWeight: 600, color: "primary.main" }}>
                  Generous Portion Size
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary" sx={{ lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
                  A generous portion is about 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches (6cm x 6cm) - perfect for cake-focused events 
                  or when the cake is the main dessert. This size is ideal for birthdays, anniversaries, and special 
                  occasions where people really want to enjoy the Ukrainian flavors.

                  Honey cake is rich and sweet, so people often eat smaller portions. The honey flavor is very

                  smaller portions than you might for other cakes.
