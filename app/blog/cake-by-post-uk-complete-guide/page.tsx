                  When I started my cake business in Leeds, I never thought about sending cakes by post. But then customers 
                  started asking me - "Can you send cake to my daughter in London?" or "My mum lives in Manchester, can she get your honey cake?" 
                  So I learned how to make cakes that travel good through the post.

                <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 3, lineHeight: 1.8, fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
                  The idea is simple - make cakes that fit through normal UK letterboxes, so even if nobody is home, 
                  the cake still arrives. I use special packaging that keeps cakes fresh for few days, and honey cake 
                  is perfect for this because it doesn't go bad quickly like other cakes.

              In Ukraine, we make honey cake (we call it Medovik) for special occasions, and it's perfect for sending by post. 
              My grandmother taught me this recipe, and I never thought it would work so good for postal delivery until I tried it.

                        In Ukraine, we always use honey in cakes because it keeps them fresh for long time. I tested this 
                        with my honey cake - it stays good for up to 7 days without fridge, which is perfect for sending by post.

                        When I first tried to send regular cake by post, it arrived all broken. But honey cake is different - 
                        it has many thin layers that stick together good, so it doesn't break during transport. Each layer stays in place.
