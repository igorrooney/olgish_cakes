# GA4 Admin Tracking Fix - Completed

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Issue:** Admin pages were being tracked, inflating analytics by 19.5%  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## What Was Changed

**File:** `/app/layout.tsx`

**Change:** Added client-side path detection to exclude admin pages from GA4 tracking.

**Before:**
```javascript
gtag('config', 'G-QGQC58H2LD', {
  page_title: document.title,
  page_location: window.location.href,
  // ... tracked ALL pages including /admin/*
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Exclude admin, API, and studio pages from tracking
const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
const isAdminPage = currentPath.startsWith('/admin') || 
                   currentPath.startsWith('/api') || 
                   currentPath.startsWith('/studio');

if (!isAdminPage) {
  gtag('config', 'G-QGQC58H2LD', {
    // ... only track customer pages
  });
} else {
  gtag('config', 'G-QGQC58H2LD', {
    send_page_view: false  // Don't track admin
  });
}
```

## Impact

**Before Fix (Last 30 Days):**
- Total page views: 2,234
- Admin pages: 436 (19.5%)

- Admin pages: 0 (excluded)
